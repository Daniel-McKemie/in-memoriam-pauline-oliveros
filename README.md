# In Memoriam Pauline Oliveros

The standalone Max/MSP application with a TouchOSC file.  Accompanying my release of the same title.

This program is a digital replica of Pauline Oliveros' tape delay system, with some added features.  More information on this system is in her article 'Tape Delay Techniques for Electronic Music Composers'.
